# Business Logical


* Capture image frames (timer from control center)
* Analyze pix to obtain input locators data
* use algorithm to gain actuators' moving quantity
* send commands to control boads
* loop back to the beginning procedure

1. Power up the system
2. CC Self-testing
   * Waiting all the device units to connect
   * Checking the connecting status of all transmitter wires
   * Connecting the data center
3. Drive the device end to be initialized
4. Capture the locators for analysis
5. Drive the locators moving to the right positions, loop to step 4 until accuracy is gained
6. Activate the air cylinder fixtures
7. system loops go to step 4
